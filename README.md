## 🕵️ Who’s This Sleuth?

I’m **Boopie237**, the kind of detective who solves mysteries in code and sips too much coffee while debugging.  

**Currently in my case file:**  
- 📝 Learning **JavaScript, C/C++, and Web Development**  
- 🕵️ Solving the cold case of “Why doesn’t my code compile?”  
- 🔍 Collecting clues in **functions, pointers, and DOM elements**

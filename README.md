## 🧥 About Me

I write code the way detectives write reports —  
carefully, skeptically, and usually at 2AM.

- 💻 Studying systems, backend logic, and low-level programming  
- 🧠 Interested in C, Java, Linux, and clean architecture  
- 🌒 I debug in the dark  
- ☕ Powered by coffee and unresolved edge cases

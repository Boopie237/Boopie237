## 🕸️ About Me

I am **Boopie237**, your spectral guide through the shadowy corridors of code.  
My specialties? Summoning bugs, exorcising errors, and occasionally resurrecting deprecated functions.  

I am currently haunting the realms of:  

- **Javascript** – conjuring dynamic spells that move the DOM 🪄  
- **C / C++** – communing with the spirits of memory and pointers ☠️  
- **Web Development** – weaving webs darker than a bat’s cloak 🦇  

> "I never make mistakes… I just create unexpected features."
